# Playlist + Song Selection
Playlist determines what albums show on the left

By default, Playlist will have a display ALL songs in library 

Create some database to store music and albums and the different performance penalties (Read/write vs storage?)

# Song display
Maybe can toggle with the album to use that spot to use a switch to switch between showing all albums in playlist vs what song is being played (showing album cover, lyrics, etc.)
    so just Album List and Now Playing buttons I guess

# Display
Auto resize is a WIP, seems static at the moment

# Future Features
Tools to better create + Organize albums (smart tools) with safety to prevent mass destruction
